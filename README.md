# Beginning Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup and Regex

## Background and Objective of the Project

[Radio Etiopia](https://radioetiopia.podomatic.com/) is probably my favorite music podcast, and I have been
following it pretty much since its inception in 2010. It was mainly run by two people in Portugal, along with
their friends/guest DJs. The music is mostly ambient, slow-tempoed, and eclectic. I have discovered many great
songs and artists from the podcast.

In May 2020, as announced in one of the last few episodes, one of the podcast runners sadly passed away,
bringing the podcast to its end. I was saddened by the news, feeling that I have lost a good friend whom I
have never met in real life. The podcast has become part of my life and memory over the past decade. As I do
not know for how long the website would still exist, a few weeks back this idea came to me that I could learn
about some basic web scraping and store some of the website content for my own rememberance.

For each podcast episode, I hope to obtain the following information:
1. Title and description, including song titles and artists;
2. The only picture on the page. They are usually related to the show title and truly beautiful.
3. The mp3 file.
